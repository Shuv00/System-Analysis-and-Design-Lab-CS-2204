In the modern urban landscape, effective waste management is pivotal for maintaining a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment. To harness the power of citizen engagement and revolutionize waste management practices, we present the "WasteAlert" projectâ€”a cutting-edge online platform designed to empower residents in reporting and resolving waste-related issues within their city. WasteAlert seeks to bridge the gap between citizens and local authorities, fostering collaboration for a cleaner and more livable urban environment.
